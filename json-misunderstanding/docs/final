### **Misunderstanding 31: Complex Enum with Confidence (Variant Representation Misunderstanding)**

- **Expected**: Only the selected enum variant, clearly represented as a single selection with confidence.
  
  ```json
  "complexity": {
      "variant": "Balanced",
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "justification": "We aim to maintain sufficient detail without overwhelming new learners."
  }
  ```

- **Misunderstood as**: All enum variants listed, each with its own confidence score, even if not selected.

  ```json
  "complexity": {
      "type": "complex_enum",
      "enum_name": "ConfigurationComplexity",
      "has_justification": true,
      "variants": [
          {"variant_name": "Simple", "variant_confidence": 0.0, "variant_justification": "..."},
          {"variant_name": "Balanced", "variant_confidence": 1.0, "variant_justification": "..."},
          {"variant_name": "Complex", "variant_confidence": 0.0, "variant_justification": "..."}
      ]
  }
  ```

### **Misunderstanding 32: Unit Enum Variants Wrapped as Objects**

- **Expected**:  
  ```json
  "ordering": "DifficultyAscending"
  ```

- **Misunderstood as**: A full list of unit variants represented as objects with confidence, justifications, and metadata:

  ```json
  "ordering": {
      "type": "complex_enum",
      "enum_name": "SubBranchOrdering",
      "variants": [
          {"variant_name": "None", ...},
          {"variant_name": "DifficultyAscending", "variant_confidence": 1.0, ...},
          {"variant_name": "Random", ...}
      ]
  }
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 33: Misinterpretation of Optional Fields (Null vs. Omitted)**

- **Expected** (clearly omitting optional fields):
  ```json
  {
      "aggregator_depth_limit": null
  }
  ```

- **Misunderstood as** (explicitly providing numeric defaults or always setting optional fields):
  ```json
  {
      "aggregator_depth_limit": 3
  }
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 34: Over-nesting Simple Scalars (Scalar Nesting)**

- **Expected** (scalar fields):
  ```json
  {
      "breadth": 8
  }
  ```

- **Misunderstood as** (scalar wrapped unnecessarily):
  ```json
  {
      "breadth": {"value": 8}
  }
  ```

*(Not directly occurring in your example, but a frequent misunderstanding worth including explicitly.)*

---

### **Misunderstanding 35: Redundant Enum Metadata**

- **Expected** (clean and minimal):
  ```json
  "capstone_mode": "Probabilistic"
  ```

- **Misunderstood as** (nested structure with all variants documented):
  ```json
  "capstone": {
      "mode": {
          "variants": [
              {"variant_name": "Off", "variant_confidence": 0.0, ...},
              {"variant_name": "Single", "variant_confidence": 0.0, ...},
              {"variant_name": "Probabilistic", "variant_confidence": 1.0, ...}
          ]
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 36: Justification and Confidence Fields Redundantly Nested**

- **Expected** (confidence and justification directly alongside field):
  ```json
  "aggregator_preference": 0.4,
  "aggregator_preference_confidence": 0.9,
  "aggregator_preference_justification": "..."
  ```

- **Misunderstood as** (justification and confidence nested in another object):
  ```json
  "aggregator_preference": {
      "value": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "justification": "..."
  }
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 37: Array Field Length Misinterpretation**

- **Expected**: Array length exactly matches "depth":
  ```json
  "density_per_level": [9, 9, 9, 10, 12]
  ```

- **Misunderstood as**: Array length differs from "depth" (too short or too long):
  ```json
  "density_per_level": [9, 9, 9]
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 38: Incorrect Use of "type" Metadata**

- **Expected**: JSON only includes domain data, no metadata types.
- **Misunderstood as**: Including explicit `"type": "struct"` or `"type": "complex_enum"` metadata in returned data:
  ```json
  "weighted_branching": {
      "type": "struct",
      "struct_name": "WeightedBranchingConfiguration",
      ...
  }
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 39: Enum Variants Represented as an Array Instead of a Single Selection**

- **Expected** (single selected variant clearly represented):
  ```json
  "tree_expansion_policy": {
      "WeightedWithLimits": { ... }
  }
  ```

- **Misunderstood as** (multiple variants listed with confidence):
  ```json
  "tree_expansion_policy": {
      "type": "complex_enum",
      "variants": [
          {"variant_name": "Simple", "variant_confidence": 0.0},
          {"variant_name": "WeightedWithLimits", "variant_confidence": 1.0, "fields": { ... }},
          ...
      ]
  }
  ```

---

### **Misunderstanding 40: Confidence Scores on Non-selected Variants**

- **Expected**: Only selected variants have confidence scores.
- **Misunderstood as**: All variants (even non-selected) receive confidence scores (often 0.0):
  ```json
  {"variant_name": "Off", "variant_confidence": 0.0}
  ```


### **Misunderstanding 41: Unused Probabilistic Fields Explicitly Set to Zero**
- **Expected:** Omit the field entirely when not applicable.
- **Misunderstood as:**  
  ```json
  "probability": 0.0,
  "probability_confidence": 0.0,
  "probability_justification": "Since we're using Single mode, the probabilistic aspect is unused, so we set this to 0."
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  Fields irrelevant in the current enum variant (e.g., `probability` when mode is "Single") should be omitted, not explicitly zeroed.

---

### **Misunderstanding 42: Redundant Justification for Null/Unused fields**
- **Expected:** Omit justification for unused/null fields.
- **Misunderstood as:**  
  ```json
  "dispatch_depth_limit": null,
  "dispatch_depth_limit_confidence": 0.4,
  "dispatch_depth_limit_justification": "We do not separately constrain dispatch nodes; WeightedWithLimits will guide usage at deeper levels as needed."
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  If a field is intentionally omitted or null due to another structure managing it, repeating justifications is redundant.

---

### **Misunderstanding 43: Confidence Scores Provided for Explicitly Null or Omitted Fields**
- **Expected:** Omit confidence scores if the field itself is null or unused.
- **Misunderstood as:**  
  ```json
  "leaf_min_depth": null,
  "leaf_min_depth_confidence": 0.3,
  "leaf_min_depth_justification": "Because WeightedWithLimits specifies leaf_min_depth, we do not separately define it here."
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  Confidence scores for fields explicitly omitted (managed elsewhere) add no value and confuse the data structure.

---

### **Misunderstanding 44: Enum with Partial (but incorrect) Simplification**
- **Expected:** Either fully simplified enum representation or fully expanded form (correctly).
- **Misunderstood as:**  
  ```json
  "complexity": {
      "variant_name": "Balanced",
      "variant_type": "unit",
      "variant_confidence": 0.9,
      "variant_justification": "..."
  }
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  Inconsistently mixing simplified selection (`variant_name`) with expanded fields like `variant_confidence` and `variant_type` creates ambiguity. Either fully simplify (`"complexity": "Balanced"`) or fully expand clearly and consistently.

---

### **Misunderstanding 45: Inconsistent Nested Variant Type**
- **Expected:** Enum variants clearly typed or not typed at all.
- **Misunderstood as:**  
  ```json
  "ordering": {
      "variant_name": "DifficultyDescending",
      "variant_type": "unit",
      "variant_confidence": 0.7,
      "variant_justification": "..."
  }
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  Providing `variant_type` as metadata for simple enum selections (e.g., "unit") is unnecessary and introduces confusion.

---

### **Misunderstanding 46: Justification and Confidence on the Struct Level Itself**
- **Expected:** Field-level justification and confidence only.
- **Misunderstood as:** Including struct-level confidence (`"capstone_confidence"`) and justification (`"capstone_justification"`) outside individual fields:
  ```json
  "capstone_confidence": 0.8,
  "capstone_justification": "Including a single capstone is beneficial..."
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  Struct-level confidence and justification duplicate or generalize information already specifically provided at fields, leading to redundancy.

---

### **Misunderstanding 47: Confidence and Justification at Multiple Levels Redundantly**
- **Expected:** Single level of confidence/justification per semantic choice.
- **Misunderstood as:** Nested multiple layers of confidence/justification:
  ```json
  "tree_expansion_policy_confidence": 0.9,
  "tree_expansion_policy_justification": "...",
  "tree_expansion_policy": {
      "variant_confidence": 0.9,
      "variant_justification": "...",
      "fields": {
          "aggregator_max_depth_confidence": 0.75,
          "aggregator_max_depth_justification": "..."
      }
  }
  ```
- **Explanation:**  
  Multiple nested justifications/confidence scores become overly verbose, confusing the clear single-level intention behind the choice.


### **Misunderstanding 48: Including “generation_instructions” and Other Schema Metadata in Final Output**

- **Observed**:  
  Each field is returned as an object with keys like `"generation_instructions"`, `"required"`, `"type"`, plus a nested `"value"`. For example:
  ```json
  "aggregator_depth_limit": {
      "generation_instructions": "...",
      "required": false,
      "type": "number",
      "value": null
  }
  ```
- **Expected** (if we want purely final data):  
  ```json
  "aggregator_depth_limit": null
  ```
  or *omitted entirely* if optional is set to `None`.

- **Explanation**:  
  In production usage, the final JSON typically contains just the resolved values.  Including “schema hints” (`generation_instructions`, `required`, `type`, etc.) is extraneous. Those instructions belong to the schema or the generation prompt layer, not the final data. This is effectively “leaking” the behind-the-scenes prompt or schema design into the returned JSON.

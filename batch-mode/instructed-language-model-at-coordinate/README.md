# Instructed Language Model At Coordinate

The `instructed-language-model-at-coordinate` crate is a sophisticated Rust library designed for orchestrating precise instructions to Language Models (LMs) based on spatial agent coordinates in computational contexts. It facilitates precise, deterministic output from LMs by embedding structured guidance and query instruction sets.

## Features

- **Agent Coordinate System:** Manage and associate coordinates for instructing language models.
- **Instructional Clarity:** Avoid vague instructions with `LanguageModelOutputFormatInstruction::AvoidVagueness`.
- **JSON Output:** Enforce valid JSON outputs ensuring consistency and syntax correctness with `LanguageModelOutputFormatInstruction::ProvideOutputAsValidJson`.
- **Detailed JSON Objects:** Create detailed, coordinate-specific queries via the `emit_detailed_json_objects` method.

## Core Trait Implementations

- **`GetSystemMessageAtAgentCoordinate`:** Provides mechanisms to generate system messages based on agent coordinates conveying essential metadata and structured instructions.
- **`CreateLanguageModelQueryAtAgentCoordinate`:** Formulates language model queries by integrating agent-specific instructions, producing queries ready for model consumption and interaction.

## Example Usage

```rust
use instructed_language_model_at_coordinate::{InstructedLanguageModelAtCoordinate, LanguageModelOutputFormatInstruction};

let coord = AgentCoordinate::new();
let model = LanguageModelType::new();
let llm = InstructedLanguageModelAtCoordinate::emit_detailed_json_objects(&coord);
let request = llm.create_language_model_query_at_agent_coordinate(&model, &coord, &"Your query");

println!("{}", request);
```

## Design Philosophy

The crate emphasizes precision in language modeling tasks, providing direct and comprehensive instructions to language models to ensure output reliability and accuracy. By converting complex instructions into **structured JSON** and allowing coordinate-specific modeling, it supports robust communication between computational systems and language interfaces.

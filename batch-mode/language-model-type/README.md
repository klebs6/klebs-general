# language-model-type

`language-model-type` is a Rust crate providing an enumeration of supported language model types. It abstracts the identification of models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 variations, and forthcoming O1 models within Rust applications. This facilitation enables developers to specify language model versions with precision, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Enumeration of Models:** The `LanguageModelType` enum includes variants for models like Gpt3.5Turbo, Gpt4o, Gpt4oMini, Gpt4Turbo, O1Preview, O1Mini, and O1.
- **Serialization Support:** Uses Serde with lowercase renaming for seamless serialization and deserialization.
- **Display Implementation:** Custom `fmt::Display` trait implementation transforming enum to its respective string representation.

## Installation

Add `language-model-type` to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
language-model-type = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage

Import and utilize `LanguageModelType` in your projects:

```rust
use language_model_type::LanguageModelType;

fn main() {
    let model = LanguageModelType::Gpt3_5Turbo;
    println!("Using model: {}", model);
}
```

This demonstrates the enum's application in selecting and displaying a language model type. Each variant maps to a corresponding string identifier used in practical settings.

# batch-mode-token-expansion-step

This crate provides an enumeration and accompanying logic for describing step-by-step procedures to expand tokens within a structured, axis-based workflow. Each step captures a distinct portion of the token transformation sequence, facilitating clean orchestration of batch-oriented expansions for large-scale text or data processing pipelines.

## Features

- **TokenExpansionStep Enum**  
  - Enumerates discrete stages in the token expansion lifecycle, from initial extraction and cleaning to final JSON output.
  - Can map tokens to axis definitions, integrate rephrasing processes, apply refined adjustments, and ultimately produce a well-defined JSON structure.
- **Flexible Step Generation**  
  - `vec_from_axes` and `default_steps_from_axes` methods enable dynamic or default-based creation of expansion steps, neatly factoring in user-defined axes.
- **Instructive Guidance**  
  - Every step includes a robust, self-contained instruction payload, guiding how each phase of expansion should be carried out.

## Workflow Overview

1. **Extract and Clean Data**: Removes extraneous or malformed segments from the token.
2. **Map Token to Axes**: Distributes token information across multiple axes, promoting more thorough coverage of potential categories.
3. **Enrich and Rephrase**: Enhances clarity and detail in each piece of token-based content.
4. **Apply Specific Adjustments**: Applies targeted language, style, or domain-specific constraints.
5. **Output the JSON Structure**: Produces a structured and parseable JSON object encapsulating the fully expanded token content.

This stepwise approach supports large-scale transformations by explicitly delineating and organizing the tasks. Users can integrate these steps into broader toolchains or batch pipelines for consistent, methodical expansion processes.

Open Generative Protection (OGP) License v1.0

Preamble: This Open Generative Protection (OGP) License is designed to promote
sharing and collaboration while safeguarding the Licensor’s intellectual
property. It grants broad rights to use, modify, and distribute the Software in
an open-source manner, provided that users comply with the conditions protecting
the Software’s outputs, commercial use, and the Licensor’s rights. By using the
Software, you agree to the following terms:

1. Definitions

"Software" means the open-source software, program, or code made available under
this License, including any associated documentation.

"Output" means any content, results, data, or works generated by or resulting
from the operation of the Software (for example, any text, image, model, code,
or other material produced using the Software).

"Licensor" means the original author, creator, or rights holder offering the
Software under the terms of this License.

"Licensee" means any individual or entity who obtains or uses the Software under
this License.

"Derivative Work" means any work that is based on or derived from the Software
or its Output, including any modifications, adaptations, translations, or other
alterations of the Software, as well as any material that is based on the
Output. This includes, but is not limited to, software that incorporates the
Software (in whole or part), and any edited or transformed versions of the
Output.

"Commercial Use" means any use of the Software or Output that is intended for or
directed toward commercial advantage, monetary compensation, or any form of
revenue generation. This includes (without limitation) selling the Output, using
the Output in advertising or marketing, offering services or products to third
parties that incorporate or rely on the Output, or using the Software as part of
a for-profit enterprise. Normal business internal use of the Software without
distribution or sale of the Output to third parties is not considered
“Commercial Use” for the purposes of this License.

"Trademarks" means the names, logos, trademarks, service marks, branding, or
trade names of the Licensor, including the name of the Software and any marks
associated with the Licensor or its products/services.

2. License Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor hereby grants
to each Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to do the
following:

Use and Copy: To use, reproduce, and execute the Software for any lawful
purpose, including running the Software to generate Output for personal,
educational, research, or internal purposes.

Modify: To modify, adapt, and create Derivative Works of the Software for
personal use or for distribution as permitted below.

Distribute (Non-Commercially): To distribute copies of the original Software and
any Derivative Works of the Software to others, provided that such distribution
is not for Commercial Use and that you include a complete copy of this License
with any distributed Software or Derivative Work. The Software (including any
modifications you make) must retain this original License and all of its terms,
as described in Section 4.

Generate Outputs: To use the Software to generate Output and to use, share, and
distribute such Output non-commercially, under the same terms of this
License. Any distribution or sharing of Output must preserve the Licensor’s
copyright notice (if any) and a notice that the Output was generated by the
Software licensed under this OSPL. The Output, as a copyrighted work owned by
the Licensor (see Section 3), is licensed to you for use only under the terms of
this License.

No Sublicensing: You may not sublicense the Software or Output to
others. Instead, any recipient of the Software or any Output you distribute
automatically receives rights from the original Licensor to use and/or
distribute the Software and Output subject to this License. You are not
authorized to impose any additional terms or restrictions on the Software or
Output beyond those in this License.

3. Copyright & Output Ownership

Licensor’s Copyright: The Software, including all copies and Derivative Works of
it, is protected by copyright. The Licensor retains all rights, title, and
interest in and to the Software. The Licensor also retains all rights, title,
and interest in and to any Output generated by the Software. All Output is
considered either a part of the Software or a derivative work thereof under
copyright law, and thus is owned by the Licensor.

No Independent Copyright in Outputs: Licensee acknowledges that they obtain no
independent ownership or copyright in any Output generated by the Software. You
may not claim that any Output is solely your original work or seek to obtain
intellectual property rights in the Output separate from this License. The act
of using the Software to produce Output does not grant you copyright or
ownership over that Output; such Output remains subject to the Licensor’s
copyright.

Copyright Notices: You must retain all copyright, attribution, and license
notices that are included with the Software on any copies, Derivative Works, or
Outputs that you distribute. This includes preserving any headers or text in
source files or documentation that acknowledge the Licensor’s ownership and this
License.

Contributions: If you contribute any modifications or additions to the Software
(for example, via patches, pull requests, or otherwise), you retain the
copyright to your contributions but you agree that your contributions are
distributed under the terms of this same License. You also grant the Licensor
and all other Licensees a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free
license to use, reproduce, modify, merge, distribute, and sublicense your
contributions as part of the Software. (This clause ensures that the Licensor
and community can freely use your contributed code under the OSPL.)

4. Derivative Works and License Continuity (Copyleft)

Same License for Derivatives: Any Derivative Work of the Software or Output that
you create and distribute must be licensed under this same OSPL License. You may
not distribute or sublicense Derivative Works under different terms, nor may you
make a Derivative Work proprietary or restrict others from exercising the rights
granted by this License. The intent is that modifications and improvements
remain open and subject to the same protections and obligations.

Retention of Terms: You must ensure that the terms and conditions of this
License (including all the protections for copyright, outputs, commercial use
restrictions, audit rights, trademark protection, disclaimers, etc.) apply in
full to any Derivative Work or distributed Output. You must include a copy of
this License (or the full text thereof) with any Derivative Work of the Software
you distribute, and accompany any distributed Output with a notice referring to
this License.

Downstream Recipients: Each person or entity to whom you distribute the
Software, a Derivative Work, or any Output will automatically be a Licensee
under this License, with the same rights and obligations. You are responsible
for informing recipients (for example, in documentation or a header) that the
material is licensed under OSPL and governed by these terms.

No Additional Restrictions: You may not impose any additional restrictions on
the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed by this License. For example, you
cannot require downstream users to pay you royalties or restrict them from using
the Software in certain fields (beyond the restrictions already imposed by this
License). Any attempt to further restrict the rights of downstream Licensees
will be null and void and considered a breach of this License.

(In summary, if you modify or share the Software or any of its Outputs, the
resulting work must remain under OSPL, ensuring that all recipients enjoy the
same freedoms and are bound by the same obligations, including protection of the
Licensor’s rights.)

5. Commercial Use Restrictions

Non-Commercial Use by Default: This License does not permit Commercial Use of
the Output by default. You are only allowed to use the Software and its Output
for personal, non-commercial, educational, research, or internal business
purposes (as defined in Section 1).

Separate Permission for Commercial Use: If you wish to use the Software or any
Output for profit or in any commercial context (for example, selling Output to
others, using Output in commercial products or services, or generating revenue
directly or indirectly from the Output), you must obtain a separate commercial
license or explicit written permission from the Licensor before engaging in such
use. The terms of that separate license (including possible fees or
revenue-sharing) will be subject to negotiation with the Licensor and are not
covered by this OSPL.

Unauthorized Commercial Use Prohibited: Any Commercial Use of the Output or
Software not specifically authorized by the Licensor in a separate agreement is
a violation of this License. This includes (without limitation) using the
Software’s Output in advertisements, selling or licensing Output to third
parties, offering services to third parties that primarily rely on the
Software’s Output, or incorporating the Software’s Output into a product that is
sold.

Commercial Use of Software Itself: Note: Commercial distribution of the Software
or a Derivative Work of the Software (as opposed to the Output) is also
restricted by the copyleft terms of this License. While you may charge a fee for
the physical act of transferring a copy or for warranty/support services, you
still must provide the source code and license the Software under OSPL when
distributing it. You cannot commercialize the Software in a way that removes
these open-source obligations.

Consequences: Engaging in unauthorized Commercial Use will be deemed a material
breach of this License (see Section 8 on Termination) and may subject you to
liability for damages, required disgorgement of profits made from the
unauthorized use, and other legal remedies. The Licensor reserves the right to
enforce this clause strictly to protect its interests.

6. Audit Rights

To ensure compliance with the terms of this License—particularly the
non-commercial use restrictions and protection of the Licensor’s rights—the
following audit provisions apply:

Records and Transparency: Licensee agrees to keep accurate and complete records
of its use of the Software and Outputs sufficient to verify compliance with this
License. This includes records of how Outputs are used or distributed and any
revenues or compensation received that relate to the Software or Outputs (if
any). These records should be maintained for at least one (1) year (or longer if
required by applicable law or regulation) after the relevant use or distribution
of the Output.

Audit Requests: The Licensor (or its designated independent auditor) has the
right to audit the Licensee’s use of the Software and Outputs no more than once
per calendar year, upon at least 30 days’ prior written notice to the
Licensee. The audit may include a review of documents, systems, and records
directly related to the Software’s deployment, the generation and use of
Outputs, and any financial records pertaining to revenues derived from Outputs
or the Software. The audit can be conducted in a manner that is reasonably least
disruptive—Licensee may provide necessary records electronically or permit
a visit during normal business hours, as mutually agreed.

Scope of Audit: The auditor may examine, among other things: (a) whether the
Licensee has distributed any Outputs or Derivative Works in violation of Section
5 (Commercial Use Restrictions); (b) whether appropriate license notices and
attributions have been provided with any distribution as required by Section 4;
(c) whether any Commercial Use has occurred and, if so, the amount of revenue or
profit gained from such use; and (d) whether the Licensee’s use of the Software
and Output is consistent with the data usage and any other limitations of this
License.

Confidentiality: The Licensor and any auditor must treat any confidential
information of Licensee that is not directly related to verifying compliance as
confidential and not use or disclose it beyond the need to enforce this
License. (For example, if financial records are reviewed, only information
relevant to the Software or Outputs should be noted.)

Opportunity to Cure Audit Issues: If an audit reveals a possible violation of
this License (such as unlicensed Commercial Use or failure to include proper
notices), the Licensor shall provide the Licensee with a written summary of the
findings. The Licensee will have a grace period of 14 days (or a longer period,
if specified by the Licensor in writing) from receipt of the audit findings to
respond and, if applicable, cure the violation (for example, by ceasing
unauthorized use, obtaining a proper license, paying any owed fees, or
correcting missing notices). During this cure period, no enforcement action will
be initiated by the Licensor provided the Licensee is diligently working to
resolve the issue.

Failure to Comply with Audit: If the Licensee refuses to permit an audit after
a legitimate request, or fails to reasonably cooperate with the Licensor’s audit
process, such refusal shall be deemed a breach of this License. In such case,
the Licensor will notify the Licensee of the breach, and the Licensee will have
14 days from notice to correct the breach by agreeing to and cooperating with
the audit. Failure to cure this breach (i.e., continued refusal after the grace
period) will result in automatic termination of the License (see Section 8).

Audit Remedies: If an audit (or self-report by the Licensee) reveals
unauthorized Commercial Use or other material violations, the Licensee must
within 30 days remit to the Licensor any and all gains, profits, or other
consideration obtained from such unauthorized use as shortfall payments. In
addition, the Licensor may require the Licensee to reimburse the reasonable cost
of the audit if the audit discovers a material violation (for example,
undisclosed commercial revenue or a violation causing significant harm to
Licensor’s rights). These remedies are in addition to any other remedies
available under this License or at law.

Frequency and Survival: Audits will not be conducted more frequently than once
per year unless a previous audit revealed a material breach, in which case the
Licensor reserves the right to audit again within the same year to ensure
ongoing compliance. The rights and obligations in this Section 6 survive any
termination or expiration of the License for a period of two (2) years, solely
with respect to verifying uses that occurred during the term of the License.

7. Brand and Trademark Protection

This License is limited to copyright and related rights in the Software and
Outputs. It does not grant any rights to use the Licensor’s names, logos, or
trademarks, except as explicitly allowed for attribution purposes. To protect
the Licensor’s brand and identity, the Licensee agrees to the following:

No Confusing Brands from Outputs: You may not use any Output generated by the
Software to create or promote an independent brand, product, or service that is
likely to be confused with or dilute the Licensor’s brand. In other words, you
cannot take the Output and develop a project or business that mimics the look,
name, or overall branding of the Licensor or the Software in a way that would
mislead others into thinking there is an association with or endorsement by the
Licensor.

No Trademark Use: You are expressly prohibited from using the Licensor’s
trademarks, service marks, or logos (including the name of the Software) in any
modified versions of the Software, in any Outputs, or in any related advertising
or publicity, except: (a) as required to comply with Section 4 (for example, to
say “This software is based on [Software Name] licensed under OSPL” or to retain
attribution notices), or (b) with the Licensor’s specific prior written
permission. You may not rename a Derivative Work or Output in a way that
includes the Licensor’s trademark(s) or a confusingly similar name.

Distinctive Naming: If you distribute a modified version of the Software or use
Outputs in a public project, you must adopt naming and branding that are clearly
distinct from the Licensor’s trademarks. You should also include a statement in
your documentation or about page that your project is independent of the
Licensor and not endorsed by them (unless you have obtained an official
endorsement).

No Removal of Notices: You must not remove, alter, or obscure any trademark,
logo, or branding included by the Licensor in the Software or Outputs. If the
Software has an about dialog, splash screen, or documentation that displays the
Licensor’s name or logo, you should retain those in any Derivative Work, except
that you may add an additional notice for your modifications (again, without
using the Licensor’s marks in a misleading way).

Reservation of Rights: The Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in
its Trademarks. Nothing in this License is intended to transfer, license (except
for the limited reference rights noted above), or impair the Licensor’s
ownership of its Trademarks. Any goodwill generated through authorized use of
the Licensor’s Trademarks shall inure to the benefit of the Licensor. The
Licensor may enforce its trademark rights separately from this License under
trademark law.

8. Termination

Automatic Termination on Breach: Any failure by the Licensee to comply with the
terms and conditions of this License constitutes a material breach, and the
rights granted to the Licensee under this License will terminate automatically
and immediately upon such breach. For example, any unpermitted commercial use,
failure to provide proper license notices, refusal to allow an audit, or misuse
of the Licensor’s trademarks is a violation that triggers termination.

Notice and Cure Period: Notwithstanding the above, if the Licensee breaches the
License, the Licensor (or any copyright holder of the Software) may provide the
Licensee with written notice describing the breach. The Licensee shall have
a two-week (14 day) cure period from receipt of notice to fully remedy the
breach to the Licensor’s satisfaction. During this period, the Licensee’s rights
under the License are suspended, but if the breach is cured within the 14 days,
then the Licensee’s rights under this License shall be reinstated as if no
breach had occurred. Repeated or willful violations may forfeit the opportunity
for cure at the Licensor’s discretion.

Effects of Termination: Upon termination (whether automatic or after failure to
cure), the Licensee must immediately cease all use of the Software and any
Outputs. This includes stopping all distribution of the Software, Derivative
Works, and Outputs, and discontinuing any activity that would be permitted only
under this License. The Licensee must destroy or remove any remaining copies of
the Software in their possession (including from any repositories or servers
under Licensee’s control), as well as any Outputs that are in the Licensee’s
possession or control and not yet publicly distributed. (Publicly distributed
Outputs prior to termination remain subject to this License, and downstream
recipients who received Outputs while your license was in effect may continue to
use them under these same terms.)

Post-Termination Obligations and Remedies: Termination of the License does not
relieve the Licensee from liability for violations that occurred before the
termination. The Licensor retains the right, after termination, to recover any
shortfalls or damages resulting from the Licensee’s breach. This includes the
right to demand payment for any unauthorized Commercial Use (for instance,
profits made from unlicensed use of Outputs), reimbursement for audit costs if
applicable, and any other losses incurred due to the breach. The Licensor may
also seek injunctive relief to prevent ongoing or future infringements of its
rights (e.g., to stop further use or distribution of the Software or Outputs by
the breaching party).

Survival of Terms: Provisions of this License which by their nature are intended
to survive termination (including but not limited to provisions regarding
copyright ownership, output ownership, audit rights, trademark protection,
disclaimers of warranty, limitation of liability, and dispute resolution) shall
remain in effect after termination. Termination does not affect the rights of
any other Licensees who have received the Software or Outputs from the former
Licensee, provided such other Licensees remain in compliance with the terms.

9. Dispute Resolution

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties agree to resolve disputes
as follows in an effort to avoid costly litigation:

Governing Law and Jurisdiction Choice: This License shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction chosen by the
Licensor. The Licensor reserves the right to select the jurisdiction and
governing law under which any dispute arising from or related to this License
will be adjudicated, whether in arbitration or court. The Licensee agrees to
submit to the chosen jurisdiction. (In general, the Licensor will select
a jurisdiction that has a substantial relationship to the Licensor or the
Software. The chosen law will apply except to the extent local law in the
Licensee’s jurisdiction mandates different treatment for certain consumer or
copyright issues that cannot be waived.)

Mediation First: In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to this License or the Software, the parties shall first attempt to
resolve the matter amicably through mediation. Either party may initiate
mediation by providing written notice to the other party. The parties shall
cooperate in selecting a neutral mediator and shall share the costs of mediation
equally (excluding each party’s own attorney fees). If the dispute is not
resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties within thirty (30) days from
the start of mediation (or a longer period if the parties agree), then either
party may proceed to binding arbitration as described below.

Binding Arbitration: Except for disputes involving injunctive relief (as noted
below), any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
License, or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, that cannot be
resolved by mediation shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration. The
arbitration will be administered by an internationally recognized arbitration
body (e.g., the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial
Arbitration Rules, or the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) under its
rules) or another arbitration forum selected by the Licensor. The Licensor has
the right to select the seat (location) of arbitration and the governing rules,
taking into account the nature of the dispute and the parties’ locations. The
Licensee consents to the arbitration being conducted in the forum and under the
rules chosen by the Licensor.

Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration shall be conducted in the English
language (unless otherwise agreed) before a single arbitrator selected by the
mutual agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, appointed by
the administering arbitration organization. The arbitrator must be an attorney
knowledgeable in software licensing. The arbitrator shall apply the chosen
governing law (see "Governing Law" above). All arbitration proceedings and
awards shall be confidential, except as necessary to enforce or challenge the
arbitration award in court.

Relief and Awards: The arbitrator may award any relief that a court of competent
jurisdiction could award, including compensatory damages, injunctive relief,
declaratory relief, and specific performance. The arbitrator may, in their
discretion, award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party
if allowed by law or if the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense was
frivolous or made in bad faith. The arbitration award shall be final and binding
on both parties, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction.

Injunctive Relief and Court Actions: Notwithstanding the above requirements to
mediate and arbitrate, the Licensor retains the right to seek temporary or
preliminary injunctive relief or other equitable remedies at any time from
a court of competent jurisdiction in order to protect its intellectual property
rights, confidential information, or enforce the Output/Trademark restrictions,
without first engaging in mediation/arbitration. Such an action shall not be
deemed a waiver of the right to arbitrate the underlying dispute (other aspects
of the dispute will still proceed to mediation/arbitration as above). The
Licensee agrees that any such court action may be brought in a jurisdiction
selected by the Licensor, and the Licensee consents to the jurisdiction and
venue of such court.

Venue and Jurisdiction Consent: If for any reason a dispute is permitted to be
resolved in court rather than through arbitration (for example, if a court finds
the arbitration clause unenforceable in a particular case or if a party seeks to
enforce an arbitration award), then the parties agree that such court
proceedings shall occur in a forum chosen by the Licensor. The Licensee
irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts in the
jurisdiction chosen by the Licensor, and waives any objections or defenses based
on lack of jurisdiction or inconvenient forum.

Mediation/Arbitration Language: The parties agree that all communications,
submissions, and proceedings in mediation or arbitration shall be conducted in
English, unless both parties agree to another language.

Costs: Each party shall bear its own attorney’s fees and costs in mediation or
arbitration, except that the arbitrator may award costs and fees in accordance
with the “Relief and Awards” provision above or if the arbitration rules provide
for shifting of fees. The costs of the arbitrator and any administrative fees
will be split equally between the parties, unless the arbitrator decides
otherwise in the award.

Waiver of Class Actions: The Licensee and Licensor each waive the right to
litigate disputes in court as a class action, either as a member of a class or
as a representative, or to act as a private attorney general. The arbitrator
shall have no authority to consolidate any other person’s claims with the
Licensee’s or to hear any class or collective claims.

Severability of Dispute Clause: If any part of this Dispute Resolution section
(Section 9) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be
severed and the remainder of this Section 9 shall be given full effect. For
example, if the waiver of class actions is invalidated, the rest of the
arbitration agreement would still apply.

10. Disclaimer of Warranty

THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING ANY DERIVATIVE WORKS) AND OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS"
AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. The Licensor, and any
contributors, hereby disclaim all warranties and conditions, express or implied,
including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for
a particular purpose, title, non-infringement, accuracy, or the presence or
absence of errors. You accept all risks associated with using the Software and
any Outputs generated. No advice or information, whether oral or written,
obtained from the Licensor or elsewhere, will create any warranty not expressly
stated in this License. The Licensor does not warrant that the Software will
meet your requirements or that operation of the Software will be uninterrupted
or error-free, or that Outputs will be suitable for any purpose or free from
infringement of third-party rights.(Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion of implied warranties, so certain above disclaimers may not apply to
you in full. In such case, those warranties are disclaimed to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law.)

11. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR OR ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE for any direct, indirect, incidental,
special, exemplary, or consequential damages arising out of or in any way
related to the Software, Outputs, or this License, under any legal theory
(including but not limited to contract, negligence, strict liability, or tort),
even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. This
includes, but is not limited to, damages for: loss of profits, loss of revenue,
loss of data, loss of goodwill; business interruption; procurement of substitute
goods or services; or any unauthorized use or misuse of Output by third
parties.The Licensor’s total cumulative liability in connection with this
License or the Software, from all causes of action and under all theories of
liability, shall be limited to FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (USD $50) (or the equivalent
in local currency), or the minimum amount permitted by law if a higher minimum
is required.(Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
certain damages. In such jurisdictions, the Licensor’s liability shall be
limited to the smallest amount permissible under applicable law.)

12. General Provisions

Severability: If any provision of this License is held to be invalid, illegal,
or unenforceable under applicable law, then that provision shall be deemed
modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable (if possible)
or, if modification is not possible, it shall be severed, and the remainder of
this License shall continue in full force and effect. The parties shall endeavor
in good faith to replace an invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and
enforceable provision that, as closely as possible, achieves the original intent
and economic effect of the invalid provision.

No Waiver: No term or provision of this License will be considered waived by the
Licensor, and no breach excused, unless such waiver or consent is in writing
signed by the Licensor. The failure of the Licensor to enforce any provision of
this License or to exercise any right or remedy shall not be construed as
a present or future waiver of such provision, nor limit the Licensor’s right to
enforce that provision later.

No Partnership or Agency: This License does not create any agency, partnership,
joint venture, or employment relationship between the Licensor and any
Licensee. You are acting on your own behalf and not on behalf of the Licensor,
and you have no authority to bind or obligate the Licensor in any way.

Entire Agreement: This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
Licensor and Licensees concerning the subject matter hereof and supersedes any
prior agreements, understandings, or arrangements regarding the Software and its
Outputs. Licensee acknowledges that no additional representations or promises
have been made by Licensor that are not expressly stated in this License.

Reservation of Rights: All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor in this
License are hereby reserved. No additional rights or permissions (including
implied licenses) are granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. If the
Licensee desires to make any use of the Software or Outputs that is not
permitted by this License, the Licensee must obtain a separate license from the
Licensor.

Assignment: The Licensee may not assign or transfer this License or any rights
or obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent
of the Licensor. Any attempt to assign in violation of the foregoing is
void. The Licensor may assign its rights and obligations under this License to
an affiliate or successor (such as in the event of a merger or acquisition) with
notice to the community or as part of a general transfer of the Software
project. This License shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their permitted successors and assigns.

Translations: This License may be translated into other languages for reference,
but the English version shall prevail in case of any conflict or ambiguity in
interpretation.

Headings: Section headings and summaries (italicized explanatory text) are for
convenience only and have no legal effect on the interpretation of this License.

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing the Software (or any Outputs
generated with it), you indicate your acceptance of the Open Generative
Protection (OGP) License and agree to be bound by its terms.

# Agent Coordinate

`agent-coordinate` is a Rust library designed to manage and manipulate spatial and goal-based data structures for agents in computational settings. It facilitates the definition and tracking of an agent's current location and desired target by offering a rich feature set for creation, manipulation, and querying of coordinate instances.

## Overview

`AgentCoordinate` is a utility for modeling positions and objectives within a problem space. The architecture leverages a customizable default configuration and supports dynamic updates. Various constructors allow for precise control over initial and transitional states, accommodating a variety of use cases in simulations or complex agent-based systems.

### Key Features

- **Default Initialization**: Provides sensible defaults for agent instances.
- **Flexible Creation**: Instantiates agents with defined combinations of locations and goals or none.
- **Status Inspection**: Verifies presence of location and goals ensuring robust state management.
- **Dynamic Mutability**: Allows location and goal to be conditionally set or overwritten.
- **Advanced Formatting**: Employs a user-friendly display implementation to succinctly convey agent state.

### Usage

Add `agent-coordinate` to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
agent-coordinate = "0.1.0"
```

#### Creating an AgentCoordinate

Create agents with differing levels of specification:

```rust
use agent_coordinate::AgentCoordinate;

let agent1 = AgentCoordinate::here_without_a_goal("Origin");
let agent2 = AgentCoordinate::here_with_a_goal("Start", "Finish");
let agent3 = AgentCoordinate::nowhere_with_no_goal();
```

#### Modifying an AgentCoordinate

Agents can be programmatically adjusted:

```rust
let mut agent = AgentCoordinate::here_with_a_goal("City Park", "Central Station");
agent.set_location(Some("Library"));
agent.set_goal(None);
```

#### Examining Agent State

Analyze agent properties to make informed decisions:

```rust
if agent.is_fully_specified() {
    println!("Agent has both a location and a goal.");
}
```

### Integration and Use Cases

This crate is optimal for simulation frameworks, logistics orchestration, and artificial intelligence systems that need to transcend static spatial definitions and dynamically adapt to evolving problems. It fits naturally into projects involving agents that traverse or operate within modeled environments, making it suited for game development, robotics, or any domain requiring inferential location-aware computations.

### Conclusion

With `agent-coordinate`, simplify the way agents are managed and interact within theoretical or real-world contextual environments.

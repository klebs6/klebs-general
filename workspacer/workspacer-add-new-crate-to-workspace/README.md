# workspacer-add-new-crate-to-workspace

The `workspacer-add-new-crate-to-workspace` Rust crate streamlines the integration of new crates within an existing workspace. It automates the creation of necessary scaffolding and facilitates consistent management of project components.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Automation:** Leverages async traits to handle non-blocking operations when adding new crates.
- **Dynamic Prefix Group Management:** Supports crate grouping based on shared prefixes for enhanced organization. Automatically registers crates within a matching prefix group and adjusts dependencies as needed.
- **Scaffold Generation:** Generates a directory structure and initial configuration files (`Cargo.toml`, `lib.rs`, etc.) with placeholders for easy customization.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Provides structured error handling throughout the crate addition process to ensure reliability.

## Mathematics & Automation

This crate implements efficient algorithms to detect prefix patterns and manage workspace memberships in an optimized manner. Ideal for developers requiring automated workspace expansion with minimum manual intervention.

## Usage

Implement the `AddNewCrateToWorkspace`, `CreateCrateSkeleton`, and `AddToWorkspaceMembers` traits within your workspace context. Use the `add_new_crate_to_workspace` function to seamlessly introduce a new crate.

```rust
async fn add_new_crate(&mut self, new_crate_name: &str) -> Result<(), WorkspaceError> {
    self.add_new_crate_to_workspace(new_crate_name).await
}
```

This ease of integration allows projects to scale efficiently while maintaining organizational coherence.

# workspacer-consolidate

## Overview

The `workspacer-consolidate` Rust crate offers a robust mechanism to assemble and manage consolidated representations of typical Rust code entities, such as functions, structs, enums, traits, type aliases, macros, modules, and implementation blocks, pulled together into a unified crate interface. By capturing these elements in a systematic way, developers can facilitate the introspection, documentation, and manipulation of code at a higher semantic level than mere text processing.

Our API leverages advanced paradigms of async processing using the `async_trait` for consolidated operations, allowing non-blocking management of crate interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Consolidated Item Handling**: Enumerates over nine primary consolidated Rust code entities
- **Async Trait Consolidation**: Implements an asynchronous trait interface for consolidation operations
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Utilize `ConsolidationOptions` for specific content gathering including documentation, visibility restrictions, and test items
- **Item Collection and Signature Generation**: Systems in place for the easy gathering of items and generation of syntactically correct signatures

## Mathematical and Technical Concepts

1. **Collective Representation**: Leveraging enum types to encapsulate variant forms of code constructs for ease of manipulation and display.
2. **Regular Expression Parsing**: Employed in transforming documentation comments and attributes for improved legibility and uniformity.
3. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Manipulation**: Direct access and transformation of syntax nodes to enable fine-grained introspection and output formatting.
4. **Lazy Evaluation with Async**: The asynchronous interfaces cater to efficient performance optimization via lazy evaluation, particularly under I/O-bound tasks during source retrieval operations.

## Usage

To integrate `workspacer-consolidate` into your project, add it to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
workspacer-consolidate = "0.5.0"
```

Utilize the crate by creating a custom struct that implements the `ConsolidateCrateInterface` trait, leveraging its methods in an async context for consolidating interface elements per provided options:

```rust
use workspacer_consolidate::{ConsolidatedCrateInterface, ConsolidationOptions};

async fn consolidate_interface() -> Result<ConsolidatedCrateInterface, workspacer_consolidate::CrateError> {
    let options = ConsolidationOptions::new()
        .with_docs()
        .with_private_items();

    // Assuming `my_crate` implements `ConsolidateCrateInterface`.
    my_crate.consolidate_crate_interface(&options).await
}
```

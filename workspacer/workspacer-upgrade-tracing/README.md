# workspacer-upgrade-tracing

`workspacer-upgrade-tracing` is a Rust library designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of tracing mechanisms within the `workspacer` environment. This library augments logging capabilities by providing advanced tracing functionalities, enabling developers to gain deep insights into their applications' runtime behavior.

## Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate with existing `workspacer` setups to enhance logging and debugging capabilities.
- **Advanced Tracing**: Utilize high-performance tracing tools to monitor application performance and trace execution flow.
- **Flexible Configurations**: Offers a variety of configurations to suit diverse application needs, ensuring optimal performance.

## Installation
Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
workspacer-upgrade-tracing = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
```rust
use workspacer_upgrade_tracing::init_tracer;

fn main() {
    init_tracer();
    // your application logic
}
```

By initializing the tracer, your application will actively collect tracing data, allowing you to monitor and analyze runtime behavior using compatible front-end tools.

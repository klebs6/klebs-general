# Workspacer Git Commit

`workspacer-git-commit` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate interaction with Git repositories through programmatic commit operations. This crate abstracts the complexities of creating and managing Git commits, providing a streamlined interface for handling commit creation in applications with a need for robust version control integration.

## Features

- Support for custom commit messages, author identification, and commit signing.
- Error handling and feedback mechanisms ensure smooth integration into larger systems.

## Installation
Add `workspacer-git-commit` to your `Cargo.toml`:

```

## Usage
Import the crate into your project:
```rust

fn main() -> Result<(), CommitError> {
    let commit = CommitBuilder::new()
        .message("Initial commit")
        .author("Jane Doe", "jane@example.com")
        .create()?;

    println!("Commit created: {}", commit.id());
    Ok(())
}
```

## Technical Background
Git is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code during software development. This crate interfaces with Git to abstract and automate commit operations, enhancing developer productivity by enabling seamless integration into complex Rust applications.

# workspacer-cli

`workspacer-cli` is a sophisticated Rust-based command-line interface designed for comprehensive workspace management and automation. This crate empowers users to efficiently organize, analyze, and manipulate Rust workspaces and their component crates with numerous subcommands.

## Key Features

- **Coverage Management**: Evaluate coverage for individual crates or the entire workspace using `CoverageSubcommand`.
- **Formatting Imports**: Standardize import formatting across crates to maintain code consistency.
- **Version Upgrades**: Seamlessly upgrade functions, tests, and suites with `UpgradeSubcommand` capabilities.
- **Workspace Cleanup**: Remove unnecessary files and structures using `CleanupSubcommand`.
- **Dependency Management**: Add, modify, and analyze internal dependencies effectively.
- **Documentation & Metadata**: Document crates and retrieve essential metadata and readiness for publishing.
- **Cycle Detection**: Identify and resolve circular dependencies in crates.

## Usage

To execute various commands, construct your Workspace CLI tasks typically as follows:

- Run a specific subcommand for a single crate or the entire workspace using detailed command structures.
- Customize command execution paths, manage Git cleanliness, and define workspace directories.

Here's how you might utilize a subcommand:

```bash
ws cleanup crate --crate my_crate_name
```

This command focuses on cleaning specific crates by removing transient files.

## Advanced Concepts

- **High-Ranked Trait Bounds**: Enables operations that borrow workspaces and crates effectively to avoid common Rust lifetime issues.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Enhance performance by executing tasks concurrently where applicable.

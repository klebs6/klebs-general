# workspacer-tree

A robust Rust library designed to build and render hierarchical representations of workspace dependency trees. This crate leverages asynchronous operations to efficiently construct dependency graphs, facilitating the examination and visualization of project structures.

## Features
- **Asynchronous Tree Building**: Constructs a workspace dependency tree asynchronously, enabling responsive and scalable operations.
- **Graph Representation**: Utilizes graphs internally to manage dependencies and resolve the relationships among various components.
- **Flexible Rendering**: Capable of rendering the dependency tree with optional display of version and path information.
- **Recursive Depth Control**: Supports limiting the depth of tree exploration through configurable levels.

## Usage
To use `workspacer-tree`, implement the `WorkspaceTreeBuilder` trait in your own workspace struct:

```rust
use async_trait::async_trait;
use workspacer_tree::{WorkspaceTreeBuilder, WorkspaceDependencyTree, WorkspaceError};

#[async_trait]
impl WorkspaceTreeBuilder for MyWorkspace {
    async fn build_workspace_tree(&self, levels: usize, verbose: bool) -> Result<WorkspaceDependencyTree, WorkspaceError> {
        // Implementation...
    }
}
```

## Example
Rendering a workspace tree:

```rust
let tree = workspace_builder.build_workspace_tree(3, true).await?;
println!("{}", tree.render(true, true));
```

The example above demonstrates rendering a workspace tree with depth limit set to 3, displaying both version and path details.

## Technical Insights
This crate employs graph-theoretic techniques to identify root nodes (i.e., packages with no dependencies) and construct a comprehensive tree structure. Dependency edges are efficiently managed through an adjacency list representation.

## Target Audience
Ideal for developers managing large Rust workspaces, it assists in visualizing and managing complex dependency structures.

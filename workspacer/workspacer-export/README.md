# Workspacer Export

`workspacer-export` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate seamless workspace management and exportation within your Rust projects. This crate is defined through two distinct traits: `ExtendedWorkspaceInterface` and `ExtendedCrateInterface`, which enable advanced workspace operations and interactions tailored for high-performance Rust applications.

## Features

- **Flexible Interfaces**: Provides `ExtendedWorkspaceInterface` and `ExtendedCrateInterface` for customized workspace functionalities.
- **Workspace Management**: Streamline the management of project workspace dynamics.
- **Export Operations**: Efficiently manage the export process of workspace data with easy-to-integrate interfaces.
- **Generic Design**: Interfaces are designed generically to accommodate various types and project needs, providing high adaptability.

## Usage

To utilize `workspacer-export`, implement the provided traits to match your project's workspace export needs efficiently and effectively. The use of generics allows for accommodating different types (`P`, `T`) to ensure flexibility and tailored integration.

```rust
use workspacer_export::{ExtendedWorkspaceInterface, ExtendedCrateInterface};

struct MyWorkspace<P, T>;

impl<P, T> ExtendedWorkspaceInterface<P, T> for MyWorkspace<P, T> {}

struct MyCrate<P>;

impl<P> ExtendedCrateInterface<P> for MyCrate<P> {}
```

## Edition

This crate is compatible with the Rust 2024 edition, ensuring modern syntax and compiler support.

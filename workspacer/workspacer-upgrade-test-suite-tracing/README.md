# workspacer-upgrade-test-suite-tracing

`workspacer-upgrade-test-suite-tracing` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate comprehensive testing and tracing for the upgrade process of workspace-based Rust projects. It brings precision and efficiency to the upgrade and testing pipeline, enabling developers to capture detailed execution traces and ensure accuracy during refactoring efforts.

## Features
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates with existing test setups in workspace projects, allowing for non-disruptive incorporation.
- **Granular Tracing**: Provides rich, detailed trace data, supporting deep analysis and efficient debugging.
- **Efficient Performance**: Designed for high efficiency, minimizing the performance impact during test runs.

## Mathematical Concepts
While mainly a utility crate, its tracing capabilities can be likened to mathematical functions that map every operation in the upgrade process to a corresponding trace, forming a comprehensive graph of execution.

## Usage
To include this crate in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
workspacer-upgrade-test-suite-tracing = "0.1.0"
```

Then enter:

```rust
use workspacer_upgrade_test_suite_tracing::Tracer;

fn main() {
    let tracer = Tracer::new();
    // Utilize tracing features here
}
```

This crate is compatible with the Rust 2024 edition, ensuring you have access to the latest features.

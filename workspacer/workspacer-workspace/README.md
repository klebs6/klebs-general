# workspacer-workspace

`workspacer-workspace` is a powerful Rust crate designed to facilitate the management and interaction with Rust workspaces asynchronously. At its core, this crate provides an abstraction over workspace handling, allowing for efficient crate discovery and management within a workspace defined by a `Cargo.toml` containing a `[workspace]` section.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Workspace Management**: Utilize async functions to discover and manage crates, ensuring smooth handling of I/O operations.
- **Path Compatibility**: Generic path parameter support through traits, making it adaptable to various path representations.
- **Crate Mutex**: Leverage thread-safe, async mutex-protected crate manipulation.
- **Integrity Validation**: Ensure workspace integrity by verifying each crate asynchronously.

## Technical Details

This crate makes use of:
- **Generic Programming**: Through extensive use of Rust's trait system, templates, and bounds.
- **Asynchronous Patterns**: For non-blocking I/O operations to handle potentially large workspaces efficiently.
- **Concurrency**: Via `Arc<AsyncMutex<H>>` to provide safe shared access and mutation capabilities.

For technical users, it offers interfaces for extending crate handling functionalities through trait implementations.

## Usage

To utilize `workspacer-workspace`, ensure your Rust edition is 2024. Import this crate and instantiate a `Workspace` with your custom `CrateHandleInterface`. Leverage the provided async methods like `find_items`, `new`, `validate_integrity`, and more to interact with and manage your workspace effectively.

```rust
// Example usage of workspacer-workspace
use workspacer_workspace::{Workspace,WorkspaceError};

// Define or import your crate handling type `H` that implements `CrateHandleInterface`

// Instantiate and manage your workspace asynchronously
async fn manage_workspace() -> Result<(), WorkspaceError> {
    let workspace = Workspace::new("/path/to/rust/workspace").await?;
    let crate_names = workspace.get_all_crate_names().await;
    for name in crate_names {
        println!("Crate: {}", name);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

`workspacer-workspace` is ideal for projects requiring programmatic Rust workspace manipulation while maintaining full asynchronous capabilities for high performance.

# `workspacer-workspace-interface`

`workspacer-workspace-interface` is a Rust crate designed to facilitate advanced workspace management, providing asynchronous interfaces for efficient crate handling. This crate is invaluable for developers requiring robust mechanisms to manage and query collections of crates within complex, concurrent environments.

## Features

- **Workspace Interface**: Base trait that acts as a scaffold for implementing crate management systems.
- **Asynchronous Crate Retrieval**: Leverage `GetCrates` and `GetCratesMut` traits for immutable and mutable access to crates utilizing `Arc` and `AsyncMutex` to ensure thread safety and asynchronous compatibility.
- **Crate Counting**: Use `NumCrates` trait to efficiently compute the total number of crates managed.
- **Crate Query by Name**: The `FindCrateByName` trait provides an asynchronous interface to reliably locate specific crates using their names.
- **Retrieve All Crate Names**: Implement `GetAllCrateNames` to quickly gather a list of all crate identifiers present in the workspace.

## Technical Notes

This crate makes extensive use of `async` and `await` paradigms in Rust, taking full advantage of the 2024 Rust Edition's enhancements in concurrency, allowing seamless integration into modern, asynchronous systems.

## Usage

Implement the `WorkspaceInterface` alongside additional traits to build complex data handling capabilities customized to your project needs.

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use async_trait::async_trait;
use tokio::sync::AsyncMutex;

pub trait WorkspaceInterface<P, T> {}

#[async_trait]
impl<P, T> WorkspaceInterface<P, T> for YourCustomWorkspace {
    // Implement necessary trait methods here
}
```

## Conclusion

Integrate `workspacer-workspace-interface` into your project to strengthen crate management and asynchronous processing capabilities, harnessing the power of modern Rust concurrency.

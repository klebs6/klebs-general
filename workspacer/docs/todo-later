- make sure the crate is organized properly, with each file having the proper
  name based on the single public function contained inside, and each file
  having a well named exhaustive #[traced_test] test suite testing that single
  function.

- make sure that each crate has robust ai generated logging with trace! info!
  warn! debug! error!

- function that uses ra_ap_syntax to strip out all tracing calls (this would be
  a function we could apply to the final artifact before a binary release to
  remove strings from the binary)

- consolidate should also be able to consolidate a crate and all of its internal
  dependencies in a *tree*. 

- We should also be able to consolidate trees of vendored crates with separate
  config settings from the main consolidation

- intelligent git commit with an ai generated git log comment based on the
  commit patch.

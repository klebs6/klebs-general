# Generate Report Trait

## Overview
The `generate-report-trait` is a Rust library providing a generic trait interface for report generation. Users can define their own reports by implementing the `GenerateReport` trait, which specifies both the type of report and potential errors in generation.

## Trait Interface
```rust
pub trait GenerateReport {
    type Report;
    type Error;
    fn generate_report(&self) -> Result<Self::Report, Self::Error>;
}
```

### Details
- **Type Report**: This associated type is the output of the `generate_report` method, encapsulating the report's structure and contents.
- **Type Error**: Represents possible error conditions that may arise during report generation.
- **generate_report Function**: Implement this function to produce a report, encompassing domain-specific logic, ensuring both accuracy and efficiency.

## Use Cases
The crate is designed for developers needing a flexible interface for generating diverse reports, such as in data analysis, business reporting tools, or automated documentation systems.

To enhance the flexibility and functionality of
your tracing-setup crate, consider the following
additions and configurations:

Customizable Event Formatters:

Allow users to specify their own formatters to
capture events in different formats like JSON,
plain text, or XML.

Multiple Layers Support:

Allow stacking multiple layers for different
purposes, such as writing to both a file and
a console with different filters.

Dynamic Configuration:

Support runtime configuration changes, for
instance, changing log levels or adding/removing
layers dynamically.

File Rotation:

Implement file rotation for logging to prevent
logs from growing indefinitely.

Contextual Logging:

Enhance context propagation to include additional
metadata like request IDs or user IDs.

Support for Metrics:

Integrate with metrics libraries to capture
performance-related data alongside logging.

Async Support:

Ensure that logging is non-blocking and supports
asynchronous operations, which is crucial for
high-performance applications.

Filter by Target and Level:

Provide more granular control over logging
filters, allowing users to specify which modules
and levels they are interested in.

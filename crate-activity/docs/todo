To disentangle correlated crates and better understand the relationships in your dataset, you can apply the following techniques to identify key drivers of correlation and uncover underlying patterns:

### 5. **Outlier Detection**
   Identify spikes in download activity that disproportionately drive correlations.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Analyze daily download trends for outliers using statistical methods (e.g., z-scores).
     2. Recompute correlations after removing or down-weighting outliers.

   - **Outcome**:
     - Focus on underlying patterns rather than anomalies.

### 6. **Partial Correlation Analysis**
   Evaluate correlations while controlling for the influence of a third variable.

   - **Steps**:
     1. Select potential confounding factors (e.g., overall platform activity or trends).
     2. Compute partial correlations to isolate direct relationships between crates.

   - **Outcome**:
     - Distinguish direct relationships from those influenced by shared external factors.
